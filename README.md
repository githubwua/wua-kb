Why KB?

- Reduce re-invention (don't search for the same info again and again); keep everything in one place
- Reuse something that works; repeat the success
- Recycle outdated knowledge

Folder structure:

```
note - individual notes
code - sample code (for code syntax, basic howto)
config - config files
cmd - one-pager cheatsheet on how to run a command
blog - putting ideas together
```

This README is also a scratch pad for new draft notes.

Note file format: `id[tag1 tag2 ... tag-n](title).ext`
