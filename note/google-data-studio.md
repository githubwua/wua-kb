break down dimension(s) = subsequent group-by columns. e.g. groupby month may return all info about 2020-01, 2020-02, etc.

filter = where.  Give it a name (e.g. exclude winter), then choose either include or exclude, then select the field (e.g. month) to include or exclude, and the condition (e.g. month = 12)
