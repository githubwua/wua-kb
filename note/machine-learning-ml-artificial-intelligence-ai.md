Precision: TP / (TP+FP). percentage of true positive, out of all identifed as positive.  e.g. if somene is tested positive, probability of this person being actually positive

Recall: TP / (TP+FN). percentage of true positive, out of all positive cases in the population.  e.g. how many positive cases did we find out of all positive cases?

Accuracy: (TP+TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN).  percentage of true positives and negatives out of the entire population

High precision means we can trust the test result.  When it says it is positive, it is very likely it is positve. 
High Recall means we have found the majority of the positive cases.
